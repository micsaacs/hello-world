A budding developer migrating from software test engineer, ideal end product should be an SDET.

I have always had a peculiar interest in software development and after working several years as a software tester in various forms and different methodologies including different languages ranging from Java, Javascript, PHP, .Net, Ruby, Rails etc finally decided that I become a developer or an SDET.

I am of the opinion that my vast experience as automation tester/manual tester will greatly influence my developer career and make more code more productive, anyway that is just an opinion, obviously time and results shall surely tell how true this is.
